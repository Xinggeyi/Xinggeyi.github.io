This is an example post with advanced image components.

## Image Slider

<!-- This is a simple image slider. It uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library. Check the [examples page](https://swiperjs.com/demos) for more information of what you can achieve with it. -->

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/240528PostImages/1f5275cf774328397d9cbaf6adf24a3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
