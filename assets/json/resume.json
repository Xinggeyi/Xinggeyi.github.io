This project expects to generate new knowledge in Artificial Intelligence of Things by combining sensing, machine learning, and big data analytics. Expected outcomes of this project include novel low-cost sensing methods and new hybrid machine-learning models for predictive sensory data analytics. This should provide significant benefits, such as substantially reduced operating and service costs and improved accuracy for real-time monitoring in the fields where cheap-to-implement and easy-to-service monitoring systems over large geographical areas are imperative.",
