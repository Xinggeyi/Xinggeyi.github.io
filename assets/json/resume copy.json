In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."

This project expects to generate new knowledge in Artificial Intelligence of Things by combining sensing, machine learning, and big data analytics. Expected outcomes of this project include novel low-cost sensing methods and new hybrid machine-learning models for predictive sensory data analytics. This should provide significant benefits, such as substantially reduced operating and service costs and improved accuracy for real-time monitoring in the fields where cheap-to-implement and easy-to-service monitoring systems over large geographical areas are imperative.",
